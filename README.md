# Paedobaptism Argdown Map

This project seeks to set out a chart of the relationships between various
arguments for and against paedobaptism (infant baptism) and credobaptism
(believers' baptism).

## Tools

The chart uses [Argdown](https://argdown.org), a Markdown-based argument mapping
tool. Using either a command-line tool or [an extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christianvoigt.argdown-vscode),
you can turn the Markdown into a graph-based colorful argument map, which
showcases the relationships and groupings of each assertion and argument.
